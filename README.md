# Four-Quadrant-DC-Motor-Control
Simulation and design of a four-quadrant chopper-fed separately excited DC motor using MATLAB/Simulink. The project focuses on implementing advanced closed-loop control techniques for precise speed and torque regulation. Key features include:

->Development and tuning of current and speed control loops.
->Stability analysis through Bode plot evaluation for open and closed-loop systems.
->Step response simulation to ensure minimal overshoot and fast settling time.
->Inductor design to maintain peak current ripple within 10%.
->Full operational testing across all four quadrants of the torque-speed plane.
